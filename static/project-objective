## Problem Statement ðŸ“‹

### Core Challenge
Aurimas's global distribution network possesses extensive product inventory (represented by Amazon dataset), but customers face significant challenges in discovering, evaluating, and purchasing products efficiently. Current gaps include:

- **Information Overload**: Customers struggle to navigate thousands of products without intelligent filtering
- **Time-Consuming Research**: Manual review reading and product comparison takes hours
- **Limited Accessibility**: No 24/7 personalized shopping assistance available
- **Complex Queries**: Multi-criteria searches (budget + features + reviews) are difficult
- **Geographic Disconnect**: Future: No awareness of product availability by location

### Impact of Current Gaps
- Lost sales due to poor product discovery
- High customer support costs
- Lower customer satisfaction and engagement
- Inability to scale personalized service
- Competitive disadvantage against AI-enabled retailers

### Why AI Solution
An AI-powered chatbot leveraging RAG and agentic workflows can provide instant, personalized, context-aware shopping assistance at scale, transforming the customer experience while reducing operational costs.

### Primary Objectives
- Enable natural language product discovery and information retrieval
- Reduce time-to-purchase by providing instant, accurate product information
- Increase customer satisfaction through personalized shopping experiences
- Scale customer service capabilities without proportional staff increases
- Leverage existing Amazon product data (descriptions, reviews) as knowledge base
